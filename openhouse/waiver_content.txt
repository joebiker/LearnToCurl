RELEASE OF LIABILITY AND ASSUMPTION OF RISK AGREEMENT
READ BEFORE SIGNING

In consideration of being allowed to participate in any way in the Curling Club program,
its related events and activities, I acknowledge, appreciate, and agree that:

1. The risk of injury from the activities involved in this program is significant, including the potential
for permanent paralysis and death, and while particular skills, equipment, and personal discipline may
reduce this risk, the risk of serious injury does exist; and,

2. I KNOWINGLY AND FREELY ASSUME ALL SUCH RISKS, both known and unknown, EVEN
IF ARISING FROM THE NEGLIGENCE OF THE RELEASEES or others, and assume full
responsibility for my participation; and,

3. I willingly agree to comply with the stated and customary terms and conditions for participation. If,
however, I observe any unusual significant hazard during my presence or participation, I will remove
myself from participation and bring such to the attention of the Club immediately; and,

4. I, for myself and on behalf of my heirs, assigns, personal representatives and next of kin,
HEREBY RELEASE, INDEMNIFY, AND HOLD HARMLESS THE CURLING CLUB, their
officers, officials, agents and/or employees, other participants, sponsoring agencies, sponsors,
advertisers, and, if applicable, owners and lessors of premises used for the activity (“Releasees”), WITH
RESPECT TO ANY AND ALL INJURY, DISABILITY, DEATH, or loss or damage to person or
property associated with my presence or participation, WHETHER ARISING FROM THE
NEGLIGENCE OF THE RELEASEES OR OTHERWISE, to the fullest extent permitted by law.
I HAVE READ THIS RELEASE OF LIABILITY AND ASSUMPTION OF RISK
AGREEMENT, FULLY UNDERSTAND ITS TERMS, UNDERSTAND THAT I HAVE GIVEN
UP SUBSTANTIAL RIGHTS BY SIGNING IT, AND SIGN IT FREELY AND VOLUNTARILY
WITHOUT ANY INDUCEMENT.


This is to certify that I, as parent/guardian with legal responsibility for this participant, do consent and
agree to his/her release as provided above of all the Releasees, and, for myself; my child and our heirs,
assigns, and next of kin, I release and agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Releasees from any and
all liabilities incident to my minor child’s involvement or participation in these programs as provided
above, EVEN IF ARISING FROM THE NEGLIGENCE OF THE RELEASEES, to the fullest extent
permitted by law.
